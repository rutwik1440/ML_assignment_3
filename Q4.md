The t-SNE visualization for the trained MLP show more structured and separated clusters compared to the untrained MLP. This is because during training, the MLP learns to extract meaningful features from the input data and represents them in the hidden layers, leading to better separation of data points belonging to different classes.

Conversely, the t-SNE visualization for the untrained MLP shows less structured clusters, with data points from different classes mixed together. Without the benefit of training, the untrained MLP initializes its weights randomly, resulting in a less meaningful representation of the input data in the hidden layers.

When using the trained MLP to predict on the Fashion-MNIST dataset, we can observe the following:
* 		Performance on Fashion-MNIST: The performance of the trained MLP on the Fashion-MNIST dataset is not high as on the original MNIST dataset. This is because Fashion-MNIST contains more complex images with variations in texture, color, and shape compared to the simpler handwritten digit images in MNIST.
* 		Embeddings Comparison: When comparing the t-SNE visualizations for the output from the second layer of the trained MLP for MNIST and Fashion-MNIST images, we might expect some similarities and differences:
    * Similarities: Both datasets are images, so there may be some common features learned by the MLP that are useful for both tasks. As a result, we might observe clusters of similar classes grouped together in both visualizations.
    * Differences: 		
        * Cluster Separation:
           MNIST: More distinct clusters due to structurally similar digits.
           Fashion-MNIST: Less distinct clusters due to greater variability in fashion items.

        * Intra-Class Variation:
           MNIST: Lower intra-class variation within digit classes.
           Fashion-MNIST: Higher intra-class variation within fashion item classes.

        * Inter-Class Relationships:
           MNIST: Clear distinctions between digit classes.
           Fashion-MNIST: Complex relationships between visually similar and dissimilar fashion item classes.
